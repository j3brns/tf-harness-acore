# GitHub Setup (Early Development)

## Current Status
Early development is hosted on GitHub. The project will eventually migrate to GitLab for production CI/CD.

## Quick Setup

1. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   ```bash
   # On github.com, create new repository: terraform-agentcore
   # Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
   ```

2. **Add GitHub Remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/terraform-agentcore.git
   # Or HTTPS:
   # git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/terraform-agentcore.git
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Set Default Branch** (on github.com):
   - Settings → Branches → Default branch → `main`

## Branch Protection (Recommended)

Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule for `main`:
- ✓ Require pull request before merging
- ✓ Require status checks to pass (if GitHub Actions enabled)
- ✓ Require conversation resolution before merging

## GitHub Actions (Optional for Now)

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` is for eventual GitLab deployment. For GitHub Actions during development, you can:

1. Keep using local validation:
   ```bash
   terraform fmt -check -recursive
   terraform validate
   checkov -d .
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

2. Or create `.github/workflows/validate.yml` for basic checks

## Migration Path to GitLab

When ready to migrate:
1. Create GitLab repository
2. Add GitLab remote: `git remote add gitlab <url>`
3. Push: `git push gitlab main`
4. Follow `docs/WIF_SETUP.md` for production setup
5. Archive GitHub repo or keep as mirror
